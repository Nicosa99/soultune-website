- **528 Hz**: Solfeggio "Love frequency" associated with DNA repair and transformation
- **Solfeggio Scale**: Ancient 6-tone scale (174-963 Hz) used in Gregorian chants
- **Binaural beats**: Different frequencies in each ear create perceived "beat" for brainwave entrainment

### **Evidence-Based Features**
- **40 Hz Gamma**: 2024 studies show improved working memory and reading comprehension
